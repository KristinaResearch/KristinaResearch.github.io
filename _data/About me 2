  - title: About me
    description: I am a researcher exploring the intersections of cognition, perception, and affect. I am particularly interested in how perceptual processes shape memory as connected to individual perspectives and experiences. 
I am hopeful to learn analytic methods in a PhD program to better understand these processes, with the ultimate goal of helping individuals who experience affective and memory difficulties, as can be experienced following head injury. 
Through my work on projects pertaining to trauma, psychopathology, vision, and neural mechanisms within various populations across the life span (children, Veterans, and individuals with varying mental health concerns) I have better come to understand the brain and body's physiological connectedness with emotional experiences and how these systems influence cognition, perception, and memory across development and diverse populations.

I look forward to, one day, continuing my education in a PhD program. 

Outside of the lab, I am an artist and self-taught musician who enjoys painting as well as playing music on the flute, guitar, piano, violin and (newly learned) bass guitar.
